# AI Spending Coach Service Proposal

Working Title: **Money Leak Coach**

## 1. Service Overview

**One-Line Definition** An LLM-based spending coaching service that analyzes credit card, subscription, and spending data to **identify recurring spending patterns**, **interpret why money is leaking**, and provide **actionable guidance and reminders**.

**Core Service Value** While traditional household ledgers merely show “how much was spent,” this service explains “**why you ended up spending that much**” and “**what you need to change right now**.” In other words, it aims to be a **behavior-changing financial assistant**, not just a simple tracking service.

---

## 2. Problem Definition

Although users can view their credit card statements and spending history, they frequently encounter the following issues:

- With the increase in subscriptions, it’s hard to see at a glance which ones are on auto-pay.
- Even when **small, recurring expenses**—such as coffee, food delivery, transportation, and shopping—accumulate, it’s hard to feel the impact.
- When asking, “Why am I short on money this month?” they can see the numbers but cannot **interpret the cause**.
- Even when setting a budget goal, users often veer off track; there is a lack of a **warning/feedback system** to catch this in advance.

To solve these problems, this service reorganizes users’ spending not just into simple categories, but into units of **patterns, causes, and actions**.

---

## 3. Service Objectives

This service has four goals.

1. **Automatic Detection of Recurring Spending Patterns** It automatically identifies recurring payments, small recurring expenses, spending concentrated in specific times or days of the week, and sudden spikes in specific categories.

2. Interpreting Spending Causes Instead of simply stating, “Dining out expenses increased this month,” it explains the context, such as, “With more overtime, late-night delivery orders on weekdays increased, and combined with dining out on weekends, spending accumulated.”

3. **Providing Actionable Guidance** Instead of simply saying “Cut back,” it offers actionable steps such as “This subscription is a candidate for cancellation,” “Set a delivery budget cap,” “Take on a ‘no-spend’ challenge twice a week,” or “Your current card benefits don’t match your spending habits.”

4. **Providing Real-Time Alerts and Progress Feedback** It issues early warnings when signs of overspending appear and provides easy-to-understand feedback on current progress relative to goals.

## 4. Target Users

### Primary Target

Working professionals in their 20s–40s / Freelancers / Single-person households

### Common Characteristics

- Hold at least two credit cards and use multiple subscription services
- Can’t quite figure out why they always feel short on money even though their paycheck comes in
- Find it difficult to keep a consistent budget, and instead want **automatic analysis**
- Need **interpretation and advice** more than just numbers

### Representative Persona

“Money keeps trickling out for OTT, music, cloud storage, coffee, delivery, taxis, and shopping, but I don’t know exactly where the money is leaking, and I feel anxious every month-end”

---

## 5. Key Features

## 5-1. Detection of Recurring Spending Patterns

Examples of what to detect include:

- **Recurring Subscription Patterns**: OTT, music, productivity tools, cloud services, memberships, etc.
- **Hidden Recurring Expenses**: Spending that occurs on similar days and at similar times each week
- **Small-Amount Leakage Patterns**: Frequent, small-scale expenses such as coffee, convenience stores, food delivery, and taxis
- **Abnormal Increase/Decrease Patterns**: A sudden surge in spending in a specific category compared to usual
- **Duplicate Payments/Inefficient Subscriptions**: Simultaneous payments for similar services, subscriptions that are rarely used
- **Habitual Spending Patterns**: Late-night spending, stress shopping, overspending immediately after payday

### Example of Feature Results

- “Repeated delivery spending on Friday nights over the past 8 weeks”
- “Café spending has increased by 42% compared to the average over the past 3 months”
- “Currently maintaining three similar video subscriptions simultaneously”
- “Spending within the first 5 days of the month accounts for 37% of the total budget”
